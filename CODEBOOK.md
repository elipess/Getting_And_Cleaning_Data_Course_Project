##  **Code Book**

This document describes the variables, the data inside "tidy.txt", and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data called.

### The code was performed in thes steps:
	1. Download and unzip the dataset:
    2. Load the features(measurements) of the "samsung gear"
    3. Search for the features that have mean and std on measurements.
    4. Load the train datasets.
    5. Load the test  datasets.
    6. Merge the trainingSet and the testSet sets to create one data set.
    7. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
    8. Used descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    9. Created a second independed data set that containes average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
    10. Write to a "txt" or "csv" file with the final data.

### The Data

The Date inside "tidy.txt" is based on the experiments that have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

##  The variables

### Identifiers: 

 **[1]** "subject"  - The id number of the subject  (1-30) - type "factor"

        1. WALKING 
        2. WALKING_UPSTAIRS 
        3. WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
        4. SITTING 
        5. STANDING 
        6. LAYING 

### Measurements: - type "Double"

This data containes of means and standard deviation averages of time and frequency domain variables.
